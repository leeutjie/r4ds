This section is part of a series that serves as a condensed summary of the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) book as I work through it. The purpose is to use this series as a quick reference in future.

First, we install/load the relevant packages by installing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) library. This "package" effectively contains all packages developed by *the* [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) that relate to the [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) way of thinking. This chapter focuses on specific libraries, but we install and load the whole `tidyverse` anyway.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Iteration

It is important to reduce duplication in your code instead of copying-and-pasting. Reducing code duplication has three main benefits:

1.It’s easier to see the intent of your code, because your eyes are drawn to what’s different, not what stays the same.

2. It’s easier to respond to changes in requirements. As your needs change, you only need to make changes in one place, rather than remembering to change every place that you copied-and-pasted the code.

3. You’re likely to have fewer bugs because each line of code is used in more places.

One tool for reducing duplication is functions, which reduce duplication by identifying repeated patterns of code and extract them out into independent pieces that can be easily reused and updated. Another tool for reducing duplication is **iteration**, which helps you when you need to do the same thing to multiple inputs: repeating the same operation on different columns, or on different datasets.

In this chapter you’ll learn about two important iteration paradigms: imperative programming and functional programming. On the imperative side you have tools like for loops and while loops, which are a great place to start because they make iteration very explicit, so it’s obvious what’s happening. However, for loops are quite verbose, and require quite a bit of bookkeeping code that is duplicated for every for loop. Functional programming (FP) offers tools to extract out this duplicated code, so each common for loop pattern gets its own function. Once you master the vocabulary of FP, you can solve many common iteration problems with less code, more ease, and fewer errors.

## For Loops

Imagine we have this simple tibble:

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
```

We want to compute the median of each column. You could do with copy-and-paste:

```{r}
median(df$a)
median(df$b)
median(df$c)
median(df$d)
```

But that breaks our rule of thumb: never copy and paste more than twice. Instead, we could use a for loop:

```{r}
output <- vector("double", ncol(df))  # 1. output
for (i in seq_along(df)) {            # 2. sequence
  output[[i]] <- median(df[[i]])      # 3. body
}
output
```

Every for loop has three components:

1. The output: `output <- vector("double", length(x))`. Before you start the loop, you must always allocate sufficient space for the output. This is very important for efficiency: if you grow the for loop at each iteration using `c()` (for example), your for loop will be very slow.

  A general way of creating an empty vector of given length is the `vector()` function. It has two arguments: the type of the vector (“logical”, “integer”, “double”, “character”, etc) and the length of the vector.
  
2. The sequence: `i` in `seq_along(df)`. This determines what to loop over: each run of the for loop will assign `i` to a different value from `seq_along(df)`. It’s useful to think of `i` as a pronoun, like “it”.

  You might not have seen `seq_along()` before. It’s a safe version of the familiar `1:length(l)`, with an important difference: if you have a zero-length vector, `seq_along()` does the right thing:
  
```{r}
y <- vector("double", 0)
seq_along(y)
1:length(y)
```

  You probably won’t create a zero-length vector deliberately, but it’s easy to create them accidentally. If you use `1:length(x)` instead of `seq_along(x)`, you’re likely to get a confusing error message.  

3. The body: `output[[i]] <- median(df[[i]])`. This is the code that does the work. It’s run repeatedly, each time with a different value for i. The first iteration will run `output[[1]] <- median(df[[1]])`, the second will run `output[[2]] <- median(df[[2]]`), and so on.

## For loop variations

Once you have the basic for loop under your belt, there are some variations that you should be aware of. These variations are important regardless of how you do iteration.

There are four variations on the basic theme of the for loop:

1. Modifying an existing object, instead of creating a new object.

2. Looping over names or values, instead of indices.

3. Handling outputs of unknown length.

4. Handling sequences of unknown length.
