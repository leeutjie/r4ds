This section is part of a series that serves as a condensed summary of the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) book as I work through it. The purpose is to use this series as a quick reference in future.

First, we install/load the relevant packages by installing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) library. This "package" effectively contains all packages developed by *the* [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) that relate to the [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) way of thinking. This chapter focuses on specific libraries, but we install and load the whole `tidyverse` anyway. We Also load the `lubridate` package and the `nycflights13` dataset. 

```{r load}
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")

library(lubridate)
library(nycflights13)
```

This chapter will show you how to work with dates and times in R.

# Creating date/times

There are three types of date/time data that refer to an instant in time:

1. A **date**. Tibbles print this as `<date>`.

2. A **time** within a day. Tibbles print this as `<time>`.

3. A **date-time** is a date plus a time: it uniquely identifies an instant in time (typically to the nearest second). Tibbles print this as `<dttm>`. Elsewhere in R these are called POSIXct, but I don’t think that’s a very useful name.

In this chapter we are only going to focus on dates and date-times as R doesn’t have a native class for storing times. If you need one, you can use the *hms* package.

## From Nothing

To get the current date or date-time you can use `today()` or `now()`:

```{r}
today()

now()
```

## From Strings

You can also create a date/time from a string, from individual date-time components and from an existing date/time object.

Date/time data often comes as strings. One approach to parsing strings into date-times to use the helpers provided by lubridate. They automatically work out the format once you specify the order of the component. To use them, identify the order in which year, month, and day appear in your dates, then arrange “y”, “m”, and “d” in the same order.

```{r}
ymd("2017-01-31")
mdy("January 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")

```

These functions also take unquoted numbers. 

```{r}
ymd(20170131)
```
`ymd()` and friends create dates. To create a date-time, add an underscore and one or more of “h”, “m”, and “s” to the name of the parsing function:

```{r}
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
mdy_hm("01/31/2017 08:01")
```

You can also force the creation of a date-time from a date by supplying a timezone:

```{r}
ymd(20170131, tz = "UTC")
```

## From individual components

Instead of a single string, sometimes you’ll have the individual components of the date-time spread across multiple columns. This is what we have in the flights data:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute)
```

To create a date/time from this sort of input, use `make_date()` for dates, or `make_datetime()` for date-times:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>% 
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute))
```

Let’s do the same thing for each of the four time columns in `flights.` The times are represented in a slightly odd format, so we use modulus arithmetic to pull out the hour and minute components.

```{r}
make_datetime_100 <- function(year, month, day, time) {
  make_datetime(year, month, day, time %/% 100, time %% 100)
}

flights_dt <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time), !is.na(arr_time)) %>% 
  mutate(
    dep_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, dep_time),
    arr_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, arr_time),
    sched_dep_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, sched_dep_time),
    sched_arr_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, sched_arr_time)
  ) %>% 
  select(origin, dest, ends_with("delay"), ends_with("time"))

flights_dt
```

With this data, we can visualise the distribution of departure times across the year:

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 86400) # 86400 seconds = 1 day
```

Or within a single day:

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  filter(dep_time < ymd(20130102)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 600) # 600 s = 10 minutes
```

Note that when you use date-times in a numeric context (like in a histogram), 1 means 1 second, so a binwidth of 86400 means one day. For dates, 1 means 1 day.

## From other types

You may want to switch between a date-time and a date. That’s the job of `as_datetime()` and `as_date()`:

```{r}
as_datetime(today())
as_date(now())
```

Sometimes you’ll get date/times as numeric offsets from the “Unix Epoch”, 1970-01-01. If the offset is in seconds, use `as_datetime()`; if it’s in days, `use as_date()`.

```{r}
as_datetime(60 * 60 * 10)
as_date(365 * 10 + 2)
```

# Date-time components

This section will focus on the accessor functions that let you get and set individual components. The next section will look at how arithmetic works with date-times.

## Getting components

You can pull out individual parts of the date with the accessor functions `year()`, `month()`, `mday()` (day of the month), `yday()` (day of the year), `wday()` (day of the week), `hour()`, `minute()`, and `second()`.

```{r}
datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56")

year(datetime)
month(datetime)
mday(datetime)

yday(datetime)
wday(datetime)
```

For `month()` and `wday()` you can set label = TRUE to return the abbreviated name of the month or day of the week. Set `abbr = FALSE` to return the full name.

```{r}
month(datetime, label = TRUE)

wday(datetime, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

We can use `wday()` to see that more flights depart during the week than on the weekend:

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(dep_time, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday)) +
    geom_bar()
```

There’s an interesting pattern if we look at the average departure delay by minute within the hour. It looks like flights leaving in minutes 20-30 and 50-60 have much lower delays than the rest of the hour!

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(minute = minute(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(minute) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(minute, avg_delay)) +
    geom_line()
```

Interestingly, if we look at the *scheduled* departure time we don’t see such a strong pattern:
